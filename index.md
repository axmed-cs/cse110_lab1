I am an aspiring software engineer with an interest in web development.
A quote that I think helps one obtain success in learning how to be a software engineer is:

> Slow and steady wins the race.

Some programming languages I use include:

```
  Javascript
  Python
  C++
```

+ CSS  

If I had to order them in the order I learned it then it would be
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

So far I have learned
- [X] HTML
- [X] CSS
- [ ] Javascript
